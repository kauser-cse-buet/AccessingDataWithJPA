# AccessingDataWithJPA
- followed the tutorial and created the sample application for accessing data with JPA. 
- Here a Customer entity class is created. 
- Customer respository is created extending CrudRepository. 
- Just need to crate interface for customer repository, the method are implemented in the run time. no need to implement method. 
- log project output for different query over the customer entity.
